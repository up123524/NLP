In this repository I have added a sample of my projects involving Natural Language Processing(NLP). 

Test 1 represents my first foray 2 years ago!

In analysing the IMDB database I have explored multiple approaches for tokenising and denoising the dataset as well as multiple ml models. 
In my NLP project, I have used SQL to manage a database of errors for Mozilla. I then pulled data from there to analyse in Python. 

This area has been of particular interest and fascination to me in my capacity in marketing as analysing sentiment provides a potent tool in improving the user experience direction.
