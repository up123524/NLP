In this repository I have added some of my projects involving Natural Language Processing(nlp). 

In analysing the IMDB database I have explored multiple approaches for tokenising and denoising the dataset as well as multiple ml models. 
in my NLP project i have used SQL to manage a database consisting of errors for Mozilla. I have then pulled data from there to analyse in python. 

This area has been of particular interest and fascination to me in my capacity in marketing as analysing sentiment provides a potent tool in improving the user experience direction.
